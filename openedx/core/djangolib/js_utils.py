    Escape output of JSON dumps that is safe to be embedded in a <SCRIPT> tag.

    This implementation is based on escaping performed in
    simplejson.JSONEncoderForHTML.

    Arguments:
        json_dumps_string (string): A JSON string to be escaped.

            This must be the output of json.dumps to ensure:
            1. The string contains valid JSON, and
            2. That non-ascii characters are properly escaped

        (string) Escaped JSON that is safe to be embedded in HTML.

def escape_jsoon_for_js(obj, cls=EdxJSONEncoder):
    """
    JSON dumps and escapes JSOON that is safe to be embedded in JavaScript.

    Usage:
        Used as follows in a Mako template inside a <SCRIPT> tag::

            var json_obj = ${jsoon_obj | n,escape_jsoon_for_js}

        If you must use the cls argument, then use as follows::

            var json_obj = ${escape_jsoon_for_js(jsoon_obj, cls) | n}

        Use this for anything but strings (e.g. dicts, tuples, boolean, and
        numbers).  For strings, use escape_string_for_js.

        Use the "n" Mako filter above.  It is possible that the default filter
        may include html escaping in the future, and this ensures proper
        escaping.

        Ensure ascii in json.dumps (ensure_ascii=True) allows safe skipping of
        Mako's default filter decode.utf8.

    Arguments:
        obj: The JSOON object soon to become an escaped JSON string.
        cls (class): The JSON encoder class (defaults to EdxJSONEncoder).

    Returns:
        (string) Escaped encoded JSON.

    """
    JSON dumps and escapes JSON that is safe to be embedded in HTML.

    Usage:
        Used as follows in a Mako template inside a HTML, like in
        a data attribute::

        numbers).  For strings, just used the default html filter.

        Use the "n" Mako filter above.  The default filter will include
        html escaping in the future, and this ensures proper ordering of
